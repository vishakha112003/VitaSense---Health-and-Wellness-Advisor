The VitaSense – Health and Wellness Advisor project addresses the growing need for an intelligent, user-centric platform that supports individuals in proactively managing their health and lifestyle. Traditional health monitoring often relies on isolated metrics and lacks personalized feedback, making it difficult for individuals to make informed wellness decisions.  
## Objectives
The VitaSense – Health and Wellness Advisor project aims to develop an AI-powered web application that empowers users to proactively manage their health using data-driven insights and personalized recommendations. The key objectives of this project include:
1.	Biometric and Lifestyle Data Analysis: To design a system capable of processing biometric data (such as heart rate, glucose, SpO2, etc.) and lifestyle metrics (like sleep hours, hydration, activity levels) to identify potential health risks or abnormalities.
2.	Lab Report Extraction and Interpretation: To implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and natural language processing techniques for extracting and interpreting health parameters from uploaded lab reports, enabling automated and user-specific disease predictions.
3.	AI-Powered Health Risk Prediction and Suggestions: To integrate machine learning models that assess health risks based on user data and generate tailored suggestions for improving overall wellness and mitigating potential issues.
4.	Conversational Health Advisor (Chatbot): To build a friendly and informative chatbot interface that explains predictions, clarifies health conditions, and responds to user queries using natural language understanding.
5.	User Dashboard for Health Trends and Scores: To provide an interactive dashboard that visualizes historical health data, wellness scores (based on hydration, sleep, BMI, activity), and progress over time, enabling users to track and improve their lifestyle habits.
6.	User-Friendly Design and Accessibility: To ensure the application is accessible and easy to use for individuals from diverse backgrounds, regardless of their technical proficiency or health literacy.
